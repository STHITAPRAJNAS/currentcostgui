= Python =
   Note: This only applies if you download the Python source. If you download the compiled Windows executable, you wont need to get Python separately, or any of the third-party Python modules listed here.

The biggest prerequisite is Python, as this is a Python application. I use Python 2.5, but you can probably use newer versions.

The app also uses a number of third-party Python modules:
  * matplotlib  :: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/installing.html :: I'm using v 0.99.1
  * numpy :: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=175103 :: I'm using v 1.3.0
  * scipy :: http://www.scipy.org/Download :: I'm using v 0.6.0
  * pyserial :: http://pyserial.wiki.sourceforge.net/pySerial
  * pysqlite :: http://oss.itsystementwicklung.de/trac/pysqlite/
  * pywin32  :: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018
  * setuptools :: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/
  * simplejson :: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson
  * wxpython  :: http://wxpython.org/download.php

Most of these can be installed using easy install

E.g. 
{{{
easy_install wxpython
}}}

Which saves having to manually download and install each of the prereqs.

= Serial drivers =

If you are using Windows, you will need software drivers for the cable you use to connect your CurrentCost meter to your computer. I use Prolific drivers that I downloaded from [http://www.prolific.com.tw/eng/downloads.asp?ID=31] and configured them like this:

If you are using Linux, then there is useful guidance on Ubuntu settings available at http://www.linuxuk.org/CurrentCost_Ubuntu

= CurrentCost =

This application was written to receive data from [http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=265 CurrentCost home electricity usage monitors].

These are given away for free by many electricity companies, and can also be [http://stores.ebay.co.uk/Current-Cost-Ltd bought on eBay].
