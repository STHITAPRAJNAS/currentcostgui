= Introduction =

The CurrentCost GUI can access realtime data from the National Grid and display this on the live CurrentCost graph.

= Details =

The first feature implemented is to display the UK *national electricity demand* on the live graph. This can either be displayed by itself, or overlaid on the same graph as your personal CurrentCost live data.

National Grid data is shown in blue 
Personal CurrentCost data is shown in red

Start the graph from:
 
 Download data --> Show live national electricity demand

= Implementation =

The data is obtained by screen-scaping http://www.nationalgrid.com

You can see http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/Data/Realtime/Demand/Demand60.htm for their own representation.

Screen-scraping is naturally a somewhat brittle approach - any changes to the National Grid website will break the app. However, it's an interesting data source while it's available.
